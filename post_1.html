<p>As per the Gartner report about big data skills, 2/3rd of big data skill job profiles remains vacant which means that only 1/3 are met. The numbers are an indication of the scarcity of skilled professionals in the market. However, it is a great sense of relief for aspirants as the job openings are abundant. This, in turn, has created a need for professionals with big data skills like Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL, Data Mining, and others.</p>
<p>In this article, I speak about seven big data tools and technologies that are used by successful analytics developers and organizations and can earn you a lucrative job.</p>
<h2>1. Hadoop</h2>
<p><img src="https://acadgild.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Hadoop_logo.png" alt="Big Data Hadoop" /></p>
<p>The High-availability distributed object-oriented platform, popularly known as Hadoop, is a software framework that evaluates structured and unstructured data.</p>
<ul>
<li>  Due to Hadoop, data scaling is possible without the threat of hardware failures.</li>
<li>It offers huge storage for a variety of data</li>
<li> It can virtually handle infinite coexisting tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. NoSQL (Mongo DB)</h2>
<p><img src="https://acadgild.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mongo-DB-1024x292.png" alt="MongoDB" /></p>
<p>It is an agile, principal NoSQL, open-source document database that is cross-platform compatible. MongoDB is famous because of its storage capacity and its role in the MEAN software stack. It stores the document data in the binary form of JSON document, which is otherwise the BSON type. MongoDB is mostly in use for its high scalability, obtainability, and presentation.</p>
<p>This document database has some remarkable inbuilt structures which make the database apt for businesses to make instantaneous decisions, create custom-made data-driven connections with its users. Other than MEAN stack the database is compatible with .NET applications, the Java platform, and others.</p>
<h2>3. Hive</h2>
<p><img src="https://acadgild.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Apache_Hive_logo-3-1024x922.png" alt="Apache Hive" /></p>
<p>It is data warehouse tool, built on the Hadoop platform. Apache Hive is a component of Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP). It provides a similar interface as SQL- to store data in HDP. The query language that is exclusive for Hive is HiveQL. This language interprets SQL-like queries into MapReduce jobs then deploy it to Hadoop platform. HiveQL as well supports MapReduce scripts which could be the plugin for queries. Hive augments the schema design elasticity and contributes for data serialization and deserialization.</p>
<h2>4. Apache Spark</h2>
<p><img src="https://acadgild.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Apache_Spark_logo-1024x533.png" alt="Apache Spark" /></p>
<p>Apache Spark is one of the major open source projects for data processing. It has similarities with MapReduce, however, it outpaces MapReduce with features like speed, easy user interaction, and ingenuity of analytics. Apache Spark reduces the development time that Hadoop usually takes. This leads to smooth streaming as well as collaborative analysis of data.</p>
<p>Spark has cohesive units for streaming, graph processing, and SQL sustenance. This is the reason for its entitlement as one of the fastest engine for big data processing. It supports all key big data languages like Python, R, Java, and Scala.</p>
<h2>5. Apache Kafka</h2>
<p><img src="https://acadgild.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Kafka.png" alt="Apache Kafka" /></p>
<p>Kafka is open source, partitioned, scalable, flaw permissive, highly swift and secure platform. It is important acts as a bridge between several key open source systems like Spark, NiFi, and the third-party tools.</p>
<p>Kafka has similar features as that of a messaging system, with some additional and distinctive features. It preserves feeds of messages into themes. Producers fundamentally pen down the subjects and consumers read those subjects. Since Kafka is a distributed system, subjects are segregated and simulated across numerous nodes. Messages are merely byte collections and developers could use it to stock any object in any format. Usually, String, JSON, and Avro are the most common ones.</p>
